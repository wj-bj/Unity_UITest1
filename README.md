</p>

It consist of two main parts:

* **UI Panel**: Displays the spine animation, UI elements like images and buttons.
* **Board Grid**: all tile elements of the board are placed in 3D world space.

The implemented functions are included as the following:
* Use **spine-unity plugin is 3.8** to match the provided Spine animation assets
* The scene includes two cameras :  **Main camera** renders the 3D board grid,  **UIcamera** renders the  UI elements.
* The UI uses **Screen Space - Camera** mode, allowing vfx(e.g., partical system) on UI elements without depth issues.
* Tile rotation animations are implemented using DOTween scripts.
* The tiles are randomly generated when playing the scene, and rotates if a match is detected 


## Setup
